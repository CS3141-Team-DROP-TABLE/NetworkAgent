# Revised to compile under SunOS 4.1.x (no longer necessary to install
# kernel mods).  08/07/92 RJRJr  This makefile is based on the original
# makefiles supplied with tcpdump and traceroute.

# Set DESTDIR to the directory in which the traceroute executable will be
# installed.  /usr/etc is a good place to put a network debugging tool such
# as this.

# or just edit in the name yourself.

# Explicitly define compiliation rule since SunOS 4's make doesn't like gcc.
# Also, gcc does not remove the .o before forking 'as', which can be a
# problem if you don't own the file but can write to the directory.
